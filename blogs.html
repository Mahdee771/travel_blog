            We arrived around 12.00 AM. We stayed in a camping site on the way. It was <em>magical</em> there. The best part was there was no one except us. <em>The night, the stars, the nature</em> it was more than we expected. We had a view of river and mountain just in front of our place. We stargaed all night. Had snacks,drinks,songs. We even explored the resort. That was once in a lifetime experience for me. We feared about the ghosts, prayed our salah, wondered at night and what not? Can't complain about anything. Subhanallah!!</p>

            In the early morning, after the campsite night, we started our journey towards our actual desination. The <strong>Kaptai Lake</strong>. At first we had our breakfast in a nearby hotel. Then we book a boat for one hour at 400 taka. We went to a place to have swimming. We spent about 3 hours there. On the way back, We had our lunch in the same hotel. After that we went to a resort called <em><strong style="color: brown;">Panorama Zoom Resort</strong></em>. Which is managed by the <strong>BGB</strong>. We hired kayak for 200 tk an hour per kayak. Which can accomodate 2 person.
